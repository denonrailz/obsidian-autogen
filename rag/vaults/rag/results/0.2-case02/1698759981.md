##### Q: "Is there will be 1 cluster for 1 project? Do you will create namespaces: dev, stage, test or we will create it after cluster will created?"
A: There will be one cluster for one project. You will create namespaces: dev, stage, and test after the cluster is created.

##### Q: How to start using CloudApp?
A: To start using CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise, follow these steps:

1. Get familiar with Google Cloud fundamentals: [Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/60) and [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Foundations](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/32).

2. Learn architectural aspects of CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise, including regions and networking. More information can be found [here](https://docs.cloudapp.epam.com/#/gettingstartedwithCloudAppKubernetesEnterprise).

3. Activate CloudApp by submitting a support request. For details, follow the instructions [here](https://support.epam.com/ess?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=f7325a8a97035190386e3a871153af6e&name=EPAMPaaS%2FCloudAppEngineMaintenanceAndConsulting&sysparm_copy_vars=%7B%22u_Action%22:%22Consulting%20about%20EPAM%20CloudApp%20Engine%22%7D).

4. Log in to Google Cloud console using your EPAM domain credentials. More information can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

5. Set up and configure the gcloud CLI for managing Google Cloud from the command line. Instructions can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing).

For more detailed instructions and information, please refer to the [Getting started with CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise](https://docs.cloudapp.epam.com/#/gettingstartedwithCloudAppKubernetesEnterprise) documentation.

##### Q: How to deploy gitlab runners? Do I need to to use it in same cluster or in external and how to provide them permissions?
A: To deploy GitLab Runners, you can use the Kubernetes executor and run CI/CD jobs in your Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy the runners in the same cluster or in an external cluster. To provide permissions, you can use the "overwrite" functionality to enable cluster-wide access and create a Kubernetes service account with the required role bindings. For more details on how to deploy GitLab Runners and provide permissions, you can refer to the official GitLab documentation: [GitLab Runner installation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html) and [Overwrite the Kubernetes namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html#overwrite-the-kubernetes-namespace).

##### Q: Is there will be available EPAM Vault integration?
A: Based on the provided context, there is no specific information regarding EPAM Vault integration. It's recommended to reach out to the appropriate team or contact EPAM support for more information.

##### Q: What regions are available for deploying clusters?
A: The available regions for deploying clusters are not mentioned in the provided context.

##### Q: What benefits of using GKE autopilot clusters?
A: Using GKE autopilot clusters offers several benefits:

1. Simplified management: With autopilot clusters, Google automatically manages the underlying nodes and node groups, including scaling, upgrades, and repairs. This reduces the operational overhead for managing the infrastructure.

2. Optimized resource utilization: Autopilot clusters automatically right-size the nodes based on the workload requirements, ensuring efficient resource utilization. This helps to minimize costs by eliminating overprovisioning and unused resources.

3. Reduced operational complexity: As Google handles the management of nodes, you don't need to worry about selecting and managing machine types, instance groups, or node pools. This simplifies the cluster management and reduces the complexity of infrastructure operations.

4. Enhanced scalability: Autopilot clusters have built-in scaling capabilities that automatically adjust the node capacity based on the workload demands. This ensures that your applications have the resources they need to handle varying workloads.

5. Increased cost efficiency: Autopilot clusters are billed based on the resources consumed at the pod level, rather than the entire node capacity. This means you only pay for the actual resources used by your applications, leading to potential cost savings.

For more information on GKE autopilot clusters, you can refer to the official documentation: [Autopilot overview](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview) and [Autopilot and Standard feature comparison](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/resources/autopilot-standard-feature-comparison#feature-comparison).

##### Q: What about common resources like container registry, logging, identity platform? Do you will create it for each project or it will be one for all project?
A: According to the provided context, there is no information regarding common resources like container registry, logging, and identity platform. Please provide more context or specify if you are referring to a specific project or platform.

##### Q: What components will be available after cluster will be created? Prometheus, alert-manager gitops (flux/argo)?
A: After creating the cluster, the available components will be Prometheus, Alert Manager, GitOps (Flux/Argo).

##### Q: What you recommend to read for studying GCP?
A: If you are studying GCP, I recommend starting with the following resources:

1. [Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/60)
2. [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Foundations](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/32)
3. [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Workloads](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/34)

These learning paths will provide you with a solid foundation in Google Cloud and Kubernetes. Additionally, you can consider pursuing the Associate Cloud Engineer certification for a more comprehensive understanding of GCP.

For architectural aspects specific to CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise, you can refer to the following resources:
- [GCP Certification](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMCEDU/GCP+Certification)
- [GKE Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-autopilot-is-now-default-mode-of-cluster-operation)
- [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/fleet-management/docs)

You can also find more information on CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise in the [Getting started with CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise](https://docs.cloudapp.epam.com/#/gettingstartedwithCloudAppKubernetesEnterprise) guide.

##### Q: Is there any modules for working with DB?
A: Yes, there are modules for working with databases. Some popular ones are:

- SQLAlchemy: a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a set of high-level API for interacting with databases.
- psycopg2: a PostgreSQL adapter for Python. It allows you to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute SQL queries.
- pymysql: a MySQL adapter for Python. It provides an interface to connect to a MySQL database and perform various database operations.

You can find more information and installation instructions for these modules in the official documentation:

- SQLAlchemy: [https://www.sqlalchemy.org/](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- psycopg2: [https://www.psycopg.org/](https://www.psycopg.org/)
- pymysql: [https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/)

Please note that the choice of database module depends on the specific database you are working with.
