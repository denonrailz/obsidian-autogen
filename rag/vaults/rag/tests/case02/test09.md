Some benefits of using GKE autopilot clusters include:
- Simplified management: Google handles the management of nodes and node groups, reducing the administrative burden on the client.
- Efficient resource utilization: Unused resources are automatically managed by Google, resulting in cost savings for the client.
- Auto-scaling: Autopilot clusters automatically scale resources based on workload demands, ensuring optimal performance.
- Enhanced security: Autopilot clusters are configured with recommended security settings by default, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.
- Simplified workload placement: Autopilot provides easier workload placement options, such as selecting compute classes, specifying zones for pods, using spot instances, and utilizing affinity and anti-affinity rules.
