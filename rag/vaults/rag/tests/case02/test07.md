If you are studying GCP, I recommend starting with the following resources:

1. [Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/60)
2. [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Foundations](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/32)
3. [Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine: Workloads](https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/34)

These learning paths will provide you with a solid foundation in Google Cloud and Kubernetes. Additionally, you can consider pursuing the Associate Cloud Engineer certification for a more comprehensive understanding of GCP.

For architectural aspects specific to CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise, you can refer to the following resources:
- [GCP Certification](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMCEDU/GCP+Certification)
- [GKE Autopilot](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/gke-autopilot-is-now-default-mode-of-cluster-operation)
- [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/fleet-management/docs)

You can also find more information on CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise in the [Getting started with CloudApp Kubernetes Enterprise](https://docs.cloudapp.epam.com/#/gettingstartedwithCloudAppKubernetesEnterprise) guide.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
