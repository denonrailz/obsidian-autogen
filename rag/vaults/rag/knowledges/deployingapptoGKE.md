# Deploying app to GKE

Google Kubernetes Engine Enterprise (Anthos) enables users to effortlessly manage Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions.  It offers support for the same generic Kubernetes objects found in OpenShift, including Deployment, StatefulSet, Service, and Volume.

To start deploying apps to GKE, see the following how-to guides:
- [GKE Enterprise first steps](https://kb.epam.com/display/EPMPAAS/GKE+Enterprise+first+steps)
- [Deploy an app to a GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster)<br>
Please note that you don't need to create a GKE cluster as it is described in the guide. To deploy an application, see the [Deploy an application to the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster#deploy_an_application_to_the_cluster) section.
- [Overview of deploying workloads](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/deploying-workloads-overview)
